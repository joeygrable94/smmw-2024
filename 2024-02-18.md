## The Wheel of Persuasion: Build Trust, Create, Believability & Inspire - Alex Cattoni

[<— All Talks](README.md)

- copy posse
- "Empathy Empire" ?
- trust, believability, action
- messaging roadmap and positioning
- "AI training data"
- #1 messaging mistake: Problem —> Product
  - do NOT assuming the customer understands the problem your product resolves
  - if your customers don't believe the product can help them, they are NOT going to buy it
  - conversions are a "trust" problem, not an "offer problem"
- Solution: empathize + provide believable solution + build credibility

### 6 P's to build trust

`Problem` —> `Pain` —> `Prescription` —> `Pivot` —> `Positioning` —> `Product` = `Trust`

Example: flagship product = GC Fly Tours

#### Problem: specify the core problem

```plaintext
"I help (audience) with (problem)."
```

I help *new home buyers* with showing them the potential of their community.

I help *new home buyers* experience the community they want to live in before they purchase.

I help *home builder* assure new home buyers the potential/longevity/value of a community.

I help *home huilders* visualize the development of a community.

#### Pain: relate to the core problem

```plaintext
"I am (feeling) because (reason)."
```

Home buyer: I am frustrated becuase it feels like buying a home will never be attainable.

Home buyer: I am uncertain becuase I don't know what the community will look like in 5, 10, 25 years from now.

Home buyer: I am scared of spending X amount of money with X% mortgage rate.

Home buyer: I am concerned with the future of my family and want my children to grow up in a safe and healthy environment close to good schools and parks.

Home builder: I am frustrated with our sales process becuase customers are not experiencing.

Home builder: I am concerned that our customers are not seeing the value of our community because nothing is developed on the land yet.

Home builder: I am upset that we have full visibility of the community development but our customers do not.

Home builder: I am excited to show customers the plans of the community, but are not able to visualize the potential of the community for potential home buers.

- What are the negative feelings or side effects your prospects are experiencing?
- address pain points early and validate whatever concerns they have
- the problem is not the pain, the problem is what causes pain
- assuming the role of a new home buyer what are the key pain points that a customer may experience when buying a new home?

#### Prescription

```plaintext
"To overcome (problem), you need to (unique solution)."
```

Home buyer: To overcome the uncertainty of the community's future, you need to experience the community before you purchase.

Home buyer: To overcome the fear of spending X amount of money with X% mortgage rate, you need assurance that the community will grow and provide value.

Home buyer: To overcome the concern of the future of your family, you need to feel safe, secure, and living in a healthy environment close to good schools and parks.

Home builder: To overcome the frustration of our sales process, you need to experience the community before you purchase.

Home builder: To overcome the concern that our customers are not seeing the value of our community, you need to experience the community before you purchase.

Home builder: To overcome not being able to visualize the potential of the community for potential home buyers, you need a platform that allows customers to experience all the amenities and potential of the surrounding community before they purchase.

- prescription is not the product, it's the solution
- what is the method, approach, discovery or tool that can help your prospect remedy their pain?
- this will become the foundation of your Unique Selling Proposition (USP)

#### Pivot

```plaintext
"I am on a mission to (mission) because (reason why) and I discovered (unique solution) to help (core benefit)."
```

I am on a mission to help home builder showcase all the amenities and features of a new community development becuase new home buyers need to experience the potential value and longevity of the community before they purchase. I discovered a platform that allows customers virutally tour the actual community from a 360 perspective while it is under development, and allows builders to upload various media assets and sales information to help customers feel assured by the development and visualize the potential of the community before they purchase.

- pivot from the audience (prospect) to the solution (product/service/person or brand who can help)
- who you are and why you are uniquely qualified to help/sell this product
- share a story about how the sholution was discovered
  - passion + mission + credentials = trust and authority

#### Positioning

```plaintext
"Maybe you tried (alternate solution) but (another problem)..."
```

- where are you positioned in the marketplace, what are your competitors doing to solve the problem?
- why are similar solutions not working for yous prospects in the past?

Home buyers: Maybe you tried to drive to the community and walk around, but the community is currently a construction zone
Home buyers: Maybe you tried to look at the community plans online, but it is hard to visualize the scope and scale of the community development.
Home builder: Maybe you tried using matterports to showcase individual model homes, but this doesn't allow us to showcase the surrounding community amenities undere development.
Home builder: Maybe you tried to use other 3D/360 VR tour programs, but the experience feels too generic and doesn't allow us to customize the tour experience for each of our communities or beased on the different location your viewing the community development.

#### Product

```plaintext
"The best/simplest/fastest/easiest way to overcome (problem) is to (unique positioning)."
"Try this (product) becuase _______..."
```

The best wat to overcome a home buyers uncertainty of the community's future is to be transparent as a home builder and make available to the customer the ability to see the approved site plans, community features, and amentities that are going to be built into the community.

- How have you make the solution, better, simpler, faster, or easier to achieve?

## SEO Ranking in 2024 - Jeff Oxford

[<— All Talks](README.md)

### General Tools

- Research Google Patents to see how their Search Index works
  - Google Knowledge Graph "things" not "strings"
- **Google Keyword Planner**
- [Google Natural Language API](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language) to see all the related entities in a block of text and how Google parses keyword entities
- **Ahref** keyword rankings tool
- **Surfer SEO** program to get keyword recommendations in google docs
- **Google EEAT**: Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness
  - Google does not care if your content is 100% AI written or not, it only cares if your content is EEAT
  - Written by AI —> Edited by X -> Reviewed by Z

### 1. Choose a winning topic

- high search volumn, low competition, high conversion potential
- Google Keyword Planner or Ahrefs to determine search volumn
- backlinks are the most important factor that correlate to first page search results
  - more backlinks = better rankings (generally)
  - search for a keyword topic that has high search volumn but competition with low number of backlinks
  - keyword difficulty (KD) score
  - the *authority of backlinks* are more important than the *quantity of backlinks*
  - "Guest Posting" is a great way to get backlinks from authoritative site in your industry
- buyers journey = awareness > interest > consideration > dicision
- conversion potential: keywords that target buyers searching in the interest or consideration stage
  - most content focuses on the awareness stage

### 2. Create Content that Ranks

- 5 levels of content optimization: blogger > junior SEO > SEO expert > SEO guru > Google expert
- mention your highest value keywords within the first sentances of the content
  - the higher on the page you write your content the higher ranked that keyword will score
- always mention the singular and plural version of the keyword, use synonyms and related keywords while avoiding keyword stuffing
- **related keywords** are used to distinguish the topic of the page, use Google Text & Image Search to search and see the Related Searches block
  - ie. keyword: "top shades for purchase" —> window shades or glasses shades
- **featured snippets** answer searched questions without the user having to click on the link
  - Ahref can search for keywords that do not have featured snippets and you can then create content to answer those questions
  - turn your keyword into a question and turn that into a heading/headline H1/H2/H3 (max)
  - in the very first sentance provide an answer to the question clearly and concisely 40-60 WORD LIMIT
- **entity coverage** enables you to rank for a broader range of keywords
  - *head keywords* = short, to the point: weightloss, bitcoin, michael jordan, bathtubs
  - *longtail keywords* = long and specific phrases: how to lose weight, how to buy bitcoin, michael jordan stats, best bathtubs for small bathrooms
  - Google Knowledge Graph "things" not "strings"
  - not not only use related keywords, use *related entities*.
    - 1) search keyword topic into google
    - 2) click on the very first listing
    - 3) copy and paste content into Google Natural Language tool to determine all the related entities in the content
- write in a way that Google will understand (10 steps to ensure pure SEO optimization)
  - make sure your content is accurate and factual
  - write in a wikipedia style and tone: neutral/professional tone, third person point of view
  - avoid a negative sentiment, use Google NLP to determine content sentiment
  - minimize introductions and conclusions, get to the point
  - forget about word count: content is king
    - "Information Gain Score" is used to determine how much infermation can be extracted
      - 5000 words / 20 pieces of info = 0.4% Information Gain Score
      - 500 words / 10 pieces of info = 2% Information Gain Score
    - "Gibberish Score" compares the articles word count to eht actual amount of information provided
  - short sentance length: keep content concise, SE's have a hard time understanding long sentances
    - one idea per a sentance, and do not use run on sentances
    - minmize pronouns, specifically name the objects instead of "they" or "it"
    - minimize analogies, use literal language, because SE's struggle to distinguish between the content topic and the content topic gained from the analogy

### 3. Make Your Content Stand Out

- developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/creating-healpful-content
- use Google Trends to see what is trending
- use Sales Data
- ask industry experts for quotes
- create your own statistics based on public data
- attribute articles to authors
  - ensure author pages have a relevant bio and photo

- Microsoft Copilot
- LM Studio
- LLMs are based on the `Transformer Model`
- Role > Action > Context > Execute

### `Prompt Engineering`

- how you write your prompt will dictact the quality of the response
- the more relevant keywords you use in your prompt, the better the response
- [trustinsights.ai/promptsheet](https://trustinsights.ai/promptsheet)
- create a prompt library in a space that everyone can utilize

- `Generation` > `Exctraction` > `Summarization` > `Rewriting` > `Classification` > `Quesion Answering`
  - `Generation`: for creating content, ideation
  - `Exctraction`: for data mining, data analysis, compiling data from raw information
  - `Summarization`: use LLMs to convert exctracted data into useful formats trustinstights.ai/otter
  - `Rewriting`: use LLMs to turn bad text into good text, changing tone or dictation
  - `Classification`: LLMs are really good at classifying, topic modeling, sentiment analysis
  - `Answering General Questions`: LLMs are most effecient when you provide them with data and ask them specific questions about the data

#### R.A.C.E. Prompt Structure

`Role` > `Action` > `Context` > `Execute`

1. **Role**: sets the guardails for much of the rest of the prompt and should contain keywords, phrases, and jargon that allow the language model to indentity all the relevant content in its probability matrix to accomplish the task. Be specific and load up keywords for the subject domain here. Tell the model what it should know, and set up success parameters
2. **Action**: this is the directive for what you want the language model to do. Use specific verbs like write, summarize, exract, rewrite, etc. to give the model clear directions.
3. **Context**: (optional) provides further guardrails and a place for you to add refinements to the prompt in case it doesn't behave the way you expect it to. For writing/generation tasks, you'll often need to add detauls to prevent the model from simply inventing things that are not true. For ease of use, bulleted lists work well here. Providing examples of the desired output would be appropriate here as well to ensure that the language model is clear abou what to do.
4. **Execute**: (optional) is essential for longer prompts to remind the model what it is supposed to be doing. Add formatting details here to find-tune the output, especially for summarization and extraction tasks.

### Issues with LLM

- Bias:
  - try asking LLMs the same question using different prompts that target under-represented audiences
- Copyright:
  - any output from an LLM cannot be protected by copyright, it is defacto in the public domain
- Data Ownership:
  - it you are not paying you are the product
  - data input into the LLM will be used by the company
- EU Ai Law:
  - `Deter` bad ai
  - `Detect` high risk uses
  - `Document` how ai is being user
  - `Disclose` when the user is engaging with ai content
  - `Defend` the rights of the user = `individual` > `ai`

### Closing Thoughts

- AI based summaraies from search will reduce organice traffic by 18% - 64%
  - what % of search traffic is branded versus unbranded
  - with >50% of your traffic is branded then your traffic is at risk
  - 1000 articles from small local sources is better than 1 article from a large source
- quality and quantity of (data + ideas)

### Ideas

- [INFORMed Consumer Act](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid%3AUSC-prelim-title15-section45f&num=0&edition=prelim) > run texts of legislation through LLMs to see what the output is
- WordPress plugin that adds a banner to blog posts that are over X years old
- run LLMs on my local machine and publish the data company/client wide

- **Conversation Scoring**

  - repost = +3 pts w/ commentary or +10 pts w/o commentary
  - comments = +15 pts (unlimited comments, not all comments are equal)
    - commenting on comments boost the value of the

  - velocity = 60-90 minutes after posting to get 10 comments on your post and if you respond immediatly to all 10 = get 1000+ view in 24 hours
    - the value of the interaction determines the reach of your post —> NOT the number of followers you have!
- *Best conversation starters*
